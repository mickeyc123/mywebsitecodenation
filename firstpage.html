        predicted that predicted computers would follow a simple architexture to process instructions</h1>


      <p>Von nevmann was a guy who predicted that one day computers would follow the process of input processing and
        output. Modern day computers use this simple process to make the basis of a simple computer. Home computers game
        consoles such as Xbox and play station all use this process.

    <p> Processing is where instructions and the calculations of programs will be carried out. On the Von nevmann
      architecture processing was where sums were put in to be processed. On a modern day computer the process has a
      CPU a central processing unit that will carry out instructions that are given to it.</p>
    <p>Input and output allows humans to interact with a machine the idea is that you put a sum or an equation in for
      the machine to process it once the process has finish then the information will be outputted from the machine.
      With a modern day machine an input device would be something like a mouse or a keyboard that will give
      instructions and an output device would be something like a set of speakers or a monitor that will receive the
      instructions after the process has been carried out or a monitor that can receive images to display.</p>
    <p>Von nevmann architecture has two places to store information while a process was being carried out long term
      and short team memory. Short term memory was a place where information was held temporally while the process was
      being carried out once the machine has no use for it the information was then got rid of. If you wanted the
      machine to permanently hold data then the data would be then held in the long term memory and the data will
      always be their into you decide to get rid of it. In a modern day computer short term storage would be known as
      RAM random access memory that temporally holds data while it is being processed by the CPU</p>
