    <h1>Data reprentation</h1>
    <p> Data is known as information and in computer information is stored as a 0and1 1=on and 0=off and that is the
      only thing a computer can do is either on or off and each bit of data makes the computer do something 8 bits of
      data represent a character also 8 bits of data is known as a bite. It is the combination of on and off that makes
      a computer carry out a task. Data is stored in a computer in different ways such as graphic audio and sensor
      outputs are stored and converted on computer system. </p>

  <div class=" numeric ">
    <h1>How numeric and alphanumeric is stored</h1>
    <p>Numeric
      American Standard Code for Information Interchange for short ASCII. The ASCII is a character coding system that
      represents 128 characters based on the English language including letters from the alphabet a-z in lower case and
      capital case A-Z including numbers 1-9 and some basic punctuation symbols. ASCII code represents txt in computer
      language. Each character in the ASCII coding method has 7 bits of information and 1 bit as a header so the
      computer will know that it is a separate bit of code. All together that makes a total 8 bits of data and 8 bits is
      a bite so each character on the SCII encoding method is a bite.

    <h2>Alphanumeric data reprensation</h2>
    <p>Binary Coded Decimal BCD is a packet decimal that convert numbers that are from1 to 9 that is represented by a 4
      digit binary number</p>

    <h3>Graphics files</h3>
    <p> Graphical data representation is a separate colour coded binary code from the main computer system that uses a
      binary code to represent a colour. There are thousands of pixels on a monitor for example of you had 1080 by 720p
      there would be 720 down and 1080 across and each pixel will have their own colour to make up an overall picture
      and the whole process is done by a graphics card inside the computer depending on the graphics card some can make
      pictures better than others some have more processors and some have less and some have more memory to store more
      data and some have less. The GPU will display 1 picture at a time and then show the next one straight away so when
      you’re playing games you will get frames per second known as fps and that is how many pictures you can view at a
      time and it will look like its moving but really your just looking at loads of pictures being shown at the same
      time. When an image is stored on a computer it is just a collection binary numbers that are used to make that
      image and it is stored on the hard drive of the computer. If you ever wanted to view an image the numbers for that
      image will be collected from the hard drive and the binary numbers will be converted into their binary colour and
      shown as pixels on the screen. If your screen resolution is 1080by1080 and you had an image that is 600by400
      pixels then only that section of the screen will display the image.</p>

  <div class="audio">
    <h4>audio data reprensation</h4>
    <p>Audio data has its own separate set of binary codes when audio is recorded or represented on a computer it is
      done in frequency and each frequency will have its own binary code. When a computer stores audio data it will
      record the audio file once using a sampling rate. A sample rate is measured in hz you can record an audio file at
      100 Hz. Audio files are displayed as analogue signals. When a computer records an audio file it will sample it the
      more times a computer samples the file the better quality it will have at a sample rate of 100hz means the
      computer is sampling a song at 100mhz a second measuring the analogue signal every time the computer does a sample
      it will record what pitch the analogue signal is at and will store it on the computer. Once the computer has
      sampled the whole file it will be stored on the hard drive of the computer and if u ever wanted it to play it back
      to you it will play the file at the frequencies it recorded while sampling the file. On an analogue frequencies
      you can have high or low pitch such as 12345 and -1-2-3-4-5 high pitch and low pitch and they are the numbers an
      audio file will be recorded at. Each number has its own binary code and the computer will store it as binary and
      put it back together when you want to use the file playing it back to you how it was recorded. So basically the
      computer makes an image of it and just plays the file off the image that it made.</p>

  <div class="sensor outputs">
    <h5> Sensor outputs</h5>
    <p>Sensor outputs are the conversions between different signals inside your computer analogue and digital. Your
      computer can receive signals and send signals it’s how different components can communicate with each other by
      using a signal to send information. You get digital and analogue but the computer can only understand digital
      signals so analogue signals would have to be converted the internet uses analogue signals so how would the
      computer be able to understand it if it can only understand digital well it will be converted using a modem/
      modulator demodulator. Some devices in your computer will give out an analogue signal and will have an input of a
      digital signal. Basically that’s all what it the conversion between analogue and digital so that different devices
      will be able to interact with your computer and understand each other.</p>

    <p>Analogue signals are wavy that go up and down and have loads of values digital has straight lines and only 2
      values on and off which is what the CPU inside the computer has is on and off.</p>
